      <h1>Become a Rescuer Today</h1>
      <br>

      <p>Rescuers help bring food from our partners to a local NYC homeless shelter. It takes less than an hour and you can set your own schedule, whether you want to help out daily, weekly, or sporadically.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p>
      2 BILLION PEOPLE could be fed yearly with the amount of food America throws away each year â€“ that is enough to end food hunger in the world. Be a part of the solution and join us and other rescuers to help deliver excess food to those who need it.
