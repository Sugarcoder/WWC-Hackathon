<h1>History</h1>

<br/>

<p>Founded on July 3, 2013, Rescuing Leftover Cuisine leverages the experience that the two co-founders have gained over the four years of leading a food rescue at their university. The co-founders, Robert Lee and Louisa Chen were both part of a university organization called <%= link_to 'Two Birds One Stone', "https://www.facebook.com/twobirdsonestonenyu" %>, which delivered leftover dining hall food on campus to homeless shelters. Throughout this time, the two have learned best practices of operations in delivering food, fostered relationships with key partners within the industry, and honed volunteer management skills. </p>
<br/>

<p>After serving on the Executive Board as President and Vice President respectively, Robert and Louisa decided that the mission of rescuing leftover cuisine should not – and would not – end neither at the end of their college careers nor at the geographical edges of their university grounds. </p>
<br/>

<p>To date, RLC has delivered over 10,000 pounds of food in New York City with a negligible delivery cost of just 2 cents a pound making us one of the most efficient systems attempting to end hunger and food waste.</p>
